# SuzyQ Board

This project is an implementation of the SuzyQ used to access [CCD](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/hdctools/+/main/docs/ccd.md) on Chromebooks.
Using CCD, you can (un)brick, debug, and flash (ex. coreboot) your Chromebook.

## Purchase

Currently, you cannot purchase the SuzyQ Board. However, we are currently in the process of preparing to sell them. If you are interested, [please reserve an order, free of charge.](https://forms.gle/YuXQzCxEkBkt8sEY9)
